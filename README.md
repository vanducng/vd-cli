# vd — Claude skills CLI

A single binary that tracks, vendors, and publishes Claude Code skills inside a Git monorepo.

## Why it exists

- One manifest (`skills.toml`) replaces ad-hoc copy-paste vendoring of upstream skills.
- `vd sync` fetches skills atomically and detects local edits before overwriting.
- `vd build` regenerates `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` byte-for-byte from the manifest.

## Install

**go install (requires Go 1.23+):**
```sh
go install github.com/vanducng/vd-cli/cmd/vd@latest
```

**Homebrew (tap pending):**
```sh
brew install vanducng/tap/vd
```

**Build from source:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vanducng/vd-cli.git
cd vd-cli
make build          # produces ./vd
mv vd /usr/local/bin/vd
```

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Create manifest at repo root (reads live marketplace.json for defaults)
vd init

# 2. Add an upstream skill
vd add browserbase/skills/browser --as browser

# 3. Vendor it into skills/
vd sync

# 4. Regenerate .claude-plugin/ and Codex repo-scope links
vd build

# 5. Install local skills into Codex user scope
vd install codex
```

After these steps:
- `skills/browser/` contains the vendored skill.
- `.agents/skills/browser` is a repo-scoped Codex skill symlink.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `plugin.json` are regenerated (byte-equal to current in bundle mode).

## Command summary

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `vd init` | Create `skills.toml` at the repo root |
| `vd add <source>/<path>` | Register an upstream skill in `skills.toml` |
| `vd list` | Print tracked skills as a table |
| `vd sync [skill...]` | Vendor tracked/pinned skills into `skills/`; runs `vd build` |
| `vd update [skill...]` | Bump tracked skills to upstream HEAD |
| `vd diff <skill>` | Show diff between upstream cache and local `skills/<name>/` |
| `vd doctor` | Report drift between `skills.lock` and the local `skills/` tree |
| `vd pin <skill> <sha>` | Lock a skill to a specific commit SHA |
| `vd detach <skill>` | Stop tracking a skill; leaves files on disk untouched |
| `vd remove <skill>` | Remove a skill from manifest, lock, and (by default) disk |
| `vd build [target...]` | Emit `marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, and `.agents/skills/` symlinks |
| `vd install [agent] [skill...]` | Install local skills into Codex or Claude Code |
| `vd cache clean` | Delete the `.vd-cache/` download cache |

## Global flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Suppress non-error output |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Verbose output (reserved) |
| `--root` | | Override repo root path (takes precedence over `VD_ROOT`) |
| `--version` | | Print `vd <version>` |

Repo root resolution order: `--root` flag → `VD_ROOT` env var → walk up from CWD to the first `.git/`. Both `--root` and `VD_ROOT` are validated (must exist, must be a directory) and error out on invalid values rather than silently falling through.

## Environment variables

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VD_ROOT` | Pin a default repo root |
| `VD_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | Disable the upstream version check |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | Override the cache directory (default `~/.cache`) |
| `CI` | When set, the version check is auto-disabled |

## Upstream version check

`vd` checks GitHub for new releases at most once per 24 hours and prints a one-line nudge to stderr when a newer version is available:

```
vd 1.0.0 (latest: 1.1.0). Upgrade: brew upgrade vd
```

The check runs in the background and is silent on any failure (offline, rate-limited, parse error). It is disabled automatically for `dev` builds, when `CI` is set, and when stderr is not a terminal (so piped output is unaffected). Set `VD_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable it explicitly, or pass `--quiet` / `-q` to suppress the nudge for a single invocation.
