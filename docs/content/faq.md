## Why is the CLI called `vd` when there's already a `vd` Claude plugin?

Both belong to the same user and repo — this is intentional duplication, not a conflict.

- **The Claude plugin** named `vd` is the skill bundle that users install via `/plugin install vd@vanducng-skills`. It lives in `.claude-plugin/` and appears in Claude Code as `vd:research`, `vd:plan`, etc.
- **The CLI binary** named `vd` is a Go program (the [`vanducng/vd-cli`](https://github.com/vanducng/vd-cli) repo) that manages a skill repo (fetch, sync, build). It runs in your terminal.

The two artifacts share a name because they belong to the same ecosystem. The CLI *builds* the plugin. There is no runtime conflict: one is a PATH binary, the other is a Claude Code plugin identifier.

---

## Does `vd` conflict with `visidata` (which also uses `vd`)?

Possibly, if you have `visidata` installed. Both install a binary named `vd`.

Options:
- **Alias one of them:** add `alias vd-skills=/usr/local/bin/vd` or `alias vd-csv=~/.local/bin/vd` to your shell profile.
- **Use the full path:** call `./vd` from the build directory (or wherever you installed it) instead of relying on PATH resolution.
- **Rename the build output:** `make build BINARY=skill` produces a `skill` binary you can put on PATH under a different name.

The conflict is acknowledged and accepted. Most users of this repo do not use visidata interactively; those who do can alias safely.

## What does "refuse-on-dirty" mean and why does it exist?

When `vd sync` detects that a skill directory has been modified locally (filesystem tree hash differs from the hash recorded in `skills.lock` at last sync), it **refuses to overwrite** and prints:

```
REFUSED  browser — local edits detected
         run: vd detach browser  (keep edits) or use --force (overwrite)
```

This protects work. Without this guard, a `vd sync` or `vd update` would silently discard local patches you made to a vendored skill.

**Your options when refused:**

| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Keep your edits, stop syncing | `vd detach browser` then edit freely |
| Discard your edits, fetch upstream | `vd sync --force browser` |
| Inspect what changed | `vd diff browser` |

The refuse-on-dirty check only triggers when a `TreeHash` was recorded at last sync. Skills synced before `skills.lock` recorded tree hashes will fall through to a normal fetch.

---

## Is the CLI the same repo as the skills?

No. The `vd` CLI is its own repo ([`vanducng/vd-cli`](https://github.com/vanducng/vd-cli)), forked out of the original skills monorepo. The maintained skill set lives separately in [`vanducng/skills`](https://github.com/vanducng/skills).

`vd` is a *vendoring* manager: it fetches skills from any upstream repo, pins them with a SHA, and dispatches them to your agents. `vd bootstrap` clones `vanducng/skills` into `~/.vd/skills` if you just want the published set; otherwise point `vd` at any repo with a `skills.toml`. Splitting the tool from the content keeps the CLI releasable on its own cadence (Homebrew, `go install`, `vd upgrade`) while skills version independently.

---

## Why not use `git subtree` or `git submodule`?

**Subtrees** merge upstream history into your repo. Pulling updates requires `git subtree pull`, which is non-obvious, and the commit history becomes noisy. Reverting a subtree update is painful.

**Submodules** require everyone cloning the repo to run `git submodule update --init`. They pin to a specific commit but the update workflow (`git submodule update --remote`) is error-prone and the `.gitmodules` file does not convey intent as clearly as `skills.toml`.

`vd` gives you:
- An explicit manifest (`skills.toml`) with human-readable intent.
- Atomic copy (not a git object — the skill content is just files in your tree).
- Dirty-check before overwriting.
- A `skills.lock` for reproducible installs.

The tradeoff: upstream Git history is not preserved in your repo. That is intentional — you vendor the *content*, not the history.

---

## What if two upstream sources have a skill with the same name?

`vd add` will detect the collision and error:

```
skill "browser" already tracked; use --as <alias> to register under a different name
```

Use `--as` to assign a local alias:

```sh
vd add browserbase/skills/browser --as bb-browser
vd add myorg/skills/browser --as my-browser
```

Both skills will coexist as `skills/bb-browser/` and `skills/my-browser/`.

---

## What takes priority: `[plugin.<name>]` overrides or SKILL.md frontmatter?

`[plugin.<name>]` overrides win. The full precedence chain (highest → lowest):

1. `[plugin.<name>]` in `skills.toml`
2. `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
3. Lock-derived defaults (SHA short, mtime)
4. `[targets.claude.bundle]` defaults
5. Hard-coded fallbacks (`version = "0.0.0"`, `category = "utilities"`)

Use `[plugin.<name>]` when you want to override an upstream skill's description for your specific context without editing the vendored file (which would be detected as a local edit and block future syncs).

---

## Bundle mode vs per-skill mode — which should I use?

**Use bundle mode (the default).** Here is why:

| | Bundle mode | Per-skill mode |
|--|-------------|----------------|
| Plugin installs | One: `/plugin install vd@vanducng-skills` | One per skill (fragmented) |
| First-run byte-equality | Yes (seeded from live `marketplace.json`) | No — changes existing install paths |
| Namespace in Claude | `vd:<skill>` | `<skill>:<verb>` (no shared prefix) |
| Adding a new skill | Transparent — users get it on next update | Requires users to `/plugin install` the new entry |
| Risk on `main` | Low | High — breaks existing installs if switched |

Per-skill mode is useful for exploration (generate and inspect output in a throwaway branch) or for repos where each skill is truly a standalone product with its own versioning. It is not suitable as the default for a personal skill library.

## How does `.agents/` work?

`vd build` (via the `agents` emitter) creates a `.agents/skills/` directory at the repo root. Each entry is a relative symlink pointing at the corresponding `skills/<name>/` directory:

```
.agents/
  skills/
    browser       -> ../../skills/browser
    browser-trace -> ../../skills/browser-trace
    research      -> ../../skills/research
    ...
```

This directory matches Codex's repo-scoped skill discovery path. It mirrors `skills/` without duplicating files.

`.agents/` is gitignored by convention (the symlinks are regenerated by `vd build`). If you want to commit the symlinks, remove `.agents/` from `.gitignore`.

On Windows, `vd build` falls back from symlinks to directory copies (no symlink privilege required).

---

## Can I use `vd` for skills that I author locally (not from an upstream)?

Yes. Set `mode = "detached"` in `skills.toml`:

```toml
[skills.my-skill]
  mode = "detached"
```

Or use `vd detach my-skill` on an existing tracked skill. Detached skills appear in `vd list` and `vd doctor` (as `untracked` if not in the lock, or with status from the lock if they were synced before detaching), but `vd sync` and `vd update` always skip them.

You can also just create a `skills/<name>/` directory without any manifest entry — `vd doctor` will report it as `untracked (hand-authored or detached — OK)`.

---

## Why does `vd sync` run `vd build` automatically?

To keep `.claude-plugin/` always consistent with `skills/`. After syncing a new skill, users expect to be able to install it immediately via Claude Code. Requiring a separate `vd build` step would be easy to forget.

Use `vd sync --no-build` if you are syncing multiple times in a scripted workflow and want to build only once at the end.
